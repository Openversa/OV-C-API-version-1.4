<h3>API Reference</h3>

The Openversa REST API allows you to create groups, add members, send and process messages across all message channels. You can also upload files for storage, schedule messages and send files across all channel types.

Since the API is based on REST principles, it’s very easy to write and test applications. You can use your browser to access URLs, and you can use pretty much any HTTPS client in any programming language to interact with the API.

JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you’re using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).

<h3>Account Owners</h3>

An Account owner is the same name as your username is automatically created for you when you sign up. By default, you are assigned as the administrator of this organization


<h3>Container Data Model & Object Hierarchy Concept</h3>
